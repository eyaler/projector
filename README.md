### A minimalistic lightweight semi-automatic PDF gallery with lightbox</h3>

By Eyal Gruss

Demo: [ml4des.com](https://ml4des.com)

##### Instructions:

Add PDFs to the portfolio directory, and the gallery will be created automagically!

Any image files with corresponding filenames will be used as thumbnails.

You can also point the 'folder' variable to a remote URL.

Make sure to enable indexing and for remote also CORS - see [portfolio/.htaccess](https://github.com/eyaler/projector/blob/master/portfolio/.htaccess)

##### Alternative zombie mode:

Use [bit.ly](https://bit.ly) to create a shortcut to your remote directory e.g. [bit.ly/my_awesome_portfolio](https://bit.ly/my_awesome_portfolio)

Your done! Your portfolio is now live at [jectr.github.io/#my_awesome_portfolio](https://jectr.github.io/#my_awesome_portfolio)
